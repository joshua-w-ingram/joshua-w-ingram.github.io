  <h1 class="section-title">Portfolio 2008 — Computational Design & Emergent Systems</h1>
  <p class="proj-date">2008-12-01</p>

  <p class="lead">
    During my studies in the Product Architecture and Engineering program at Stevens Institute of Technology
    and my role within the BlackBox research studio at Skidmore Owings & Merrill, I focused on applying
    computer science to design problems. This portfolio explores emergence, bottom-up rule sets,
    self-organization, optimization, and artificial intelligence in architectural and product design.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Growing Cities — Emergent Urban Development</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of predetermining city layouts through traditional zoning, this project simulates organic city growth
    through emergent processes. Like a forest ecosystem that naturally balances plant and animal life,
    this system creates a city where buildings support economic, social, civic, and industrial activities
    through interdependent relationships.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Core Concept:</strong> Buildings use neighboring structures to support growth. Each building type
    has specific needs and ratios of other building types nearby. Parks increase a building's neighboring count.
    The system calculates happiness based on mix satisfaction, neighborhood context, and proximity to desired uses.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Process:</strong> Over 10,000 generations, the system self-organizes from random initial conditions
    into coherent neighborhoods with appropriate density gradients, park distribution, and building type clustering.
    The framework was used at the ACADIA 2008 conference where multiple participants collaborated to collectively
    create a city using a bottom-up, emergent approach.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Architectural Genomics — Genetic Algorithms for Design</h2>
  <p>
    At SOM's BlackBox studio, I developed custom genetic algorithm tools to search for optimal design solutions.
    Rather than finding a single answer, the system generates collections of high-performing solutions with
    different aesthetic qualities, assisting designers in making informed decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> The GA was built as a flexible dynamic link library (.dll)
    that connects to any analysis program. By breaking geometry into computer-readable genomes, the system
    rapidly searches design spaces. Initial generations show rapid improvement, followed by convergence toward
    optimal solutions. The variety of results meeting performance criteria gives designers aesthetic choice
    while maintaining technical requirements.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Window Form Optimization — Solar Performance</h2>
  <p>
    For the Ali Al-Sabah Military Academy in Kuwait City, we redesigned sculpted wall surfaces around punched
    windows to minimize direct solar radiation across all four cardinal orientations. Using Digital Project,
    Speos, Excel, and custom genetic algorithms, the system automated generation of optimal geometries.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> Each facade and floor level was tested multiple times with varying parameters
    (wall thickness, shroud depth, glass transmittance, window count). The genome controlled X-Y position and
    Bezier curve parameters, with auto-detection of invalid geometries (self-intersection, excessive coverage).
    The algorithm produced top performers for each orientation, giving the design team aesthetic flexibility
    while meeting solar performance targets.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">View Calculator — Quantifying Architectural Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    The View Calculator is a ray-based algorithm that quantifies view quality by measuring distances and visibility
    percentages to contextual objects. Instead of calculating shading or light, it calculates distance and angle
    to landmarks and context, enabling data-driven decisions about view quality in early design stages.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Analysis Modes:</strong> Distance analysis provides general context information through color gradients.
    Landmark analysis tracks specific buildings or natural features, showing position-specific visibility.
    The tool outputs average distance, weighted distance, view vectors, percent visible, and deviation from center view.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Video Pong / Video Breakout — Interactive Systems</h2>
  <p>
    These webcam interaction games used light rings for player communication. I developed a custom blob detection
    algorithm for light sources, creating virtual paddles between two point sources. The intentional pixelization
    added complexity to gameplay. Collaboration with Mark Pollock.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Molecules — Shadow-Based Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    This webcam-based project used hand shadows on a translucent surface to create and interact with projected
    "molecules." Specific hand patterns generated atoms that could be released to interact with other particles
    and people. Molecules exhibit gravitational attraction until proximity triggers repulsion. Gestures include
    creation, release, catch, and containment. Proof-of-concept for entertainment and educational devices.
    Collaboration with Mark Pollock.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Generative Experiments — Algorithmic Exploration</h2>

  <h3>Ant Colony</h3>
  <p>
    Simulation of ant foraging behavior: ants move randomly, communicate food location upon discovery,
    return home to inform others, then path back to food. The algorithm partially simulates communication
    through predefined random paths rather than true pheromone trails.
  </p>

  <h3>Flocking</h3>
  <p>
    Each object has a location and movement vector. Objects maintain personal space (1.0 unit radius).
    If no violations, they sum visible object vectors and move. If space is violated, they reverse direction
    from violators. Simple rules create complex emergent flocking patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    Simulates jellyfish movement through dual systems: boundary points move normal to center, retract near
    objects, and expand/contract based on target area. Center point moves toward boundary centroid.
    The interdependence of shape and movement creates organic motion.
  </p>

  <h3>Hexagons</h3>
  <p>
    Geometric assembly system using three base hexagons with 120-degree rotation rules. Explores how simple
    geometric constraints generate complex assemblies and patterns.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Algorithmic Art — Recursive & Parametric Forms</h2>
  <p>
    Series of generative artworks exploring recursion, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism.
    Projects include recursive tree structures, parametric curves, and self-similar geometric patterns.
    These experiments investigate how simple mathematical rules generate visually complex and aesthetically
    compelling forms.

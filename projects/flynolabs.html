  <p class="lead">
    FlynoLabs is where bold ideas meet cutting-edge prototyping. This R&D arm of Flynoceros
    serves as a playground for drone enthusiasts, engineers, and dreamers alike. We're not
    afraid to push boundaries or experiment with the unconventional—because that's where
    the magic happens.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Y-Knot</h2>
  <p>
    The Y-Knot platform was built for experimentation and adaptability, breaking away from
    traditional quadcopter designs. By rethinking configurations like Y4s and V-tails, we
    crafted a versatile design centered around a robust back beam, allowing for limitless
    customization.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the key innovations is integrated feet, addressing a common issue with Y4 designs:
    stability during landing. These feet protect inverted motors and propellers while serving
    as connection points for modular accessories.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Y-Knot also explores <strong>vertical arm configurations</strong> and sandwiched motor
    plates. Using perpendicular carbon fiber plates secured with three connection points, we
    minimized racking while maintaining strength and durability. This sturdy design has proven
    successful, offering exciting opportunities for larger drone applications.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">RatKwad</h2>
  <p>
    The RatKwad reimagines FPV drone design by challenging the traditional placement of the
    camera and battery. Inspired by the iconic view over the dash of old-school rat rods, the
    RatKwad places the FPV camera above the drone's canopy, offering pilots a unique perspective
    that includes a glimpse of their own drone in flight. This design isn't just fun—it also
    prioritizes practicality.
  </p>

  <p>
    By centering the battery within the drone, the RatKwad solves the age-old dilemma of weight
    distribution. Placing the mass at the center reduces the moment of inertia, improves
    stability, and enhances battery efficiency during turns. With a design that mirrors the
    layout of a classic rat rod, the motors and propellers mimic the wheel drive system, the
    battery acts as the engine, and the electronics are housed securely in the "cab."
  </p>

  <p>
    The result? A durable, balanced drone with a distinctive style and an exhilarating flight
    experience. Building and flying the RatKwad isn't just a hobby—it's pure fun.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Delivery Drone</h2>
  <p>
    The Delivery Drone was a passion project that combined functionality with vintage-inspired
    aesthetics. Born from the question, "What if a drone had a practical use?" the goal was to
    create a drone capable of delivering a simple, lightweight item—like a can of soda—while
    maintaining a unique, stylish design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drawing inspiration from old milk trucks, the drone features a cab-like front section for
    the electronics and battery, reminiscent of the RatKwad, and a van-style rear compartment
    for the payload. The rear section opens and closes, allowing for secure transport of the
    shipment. Balancing practicality and performance, the drone underwent three design iterations
    to achieve a sleek, functional design that performs beautifully while turning heads.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was a delightful exploration of how drones can be both useful and visually
    captivating, delivering not just goods but a sense of nostalgia and creativity.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Prototyping Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, we've designed countless prototypes and one-of-a-kind drones, each born
    from unique ideas and a passion for experimentation. From wild one-offs to functional
    innovations, these designs represent the endless possibilities and imagination that have
    fueled our work.
  </p>

  <p>
    FlynoLabs is more than a workshop; it's a think tank where creativity thrives, and every
    wild concept gets its chance to soar. From refining ultralight racing frames to testing
    new materials and configurations, we're constantly exploring what's possible. Here, every
    idea gets the wings it deserves.

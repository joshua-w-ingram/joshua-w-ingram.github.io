  <p class="lead">
    Located in one of San Antonio's most prestigious neighborhoods near Camp Bullis, this project involved
    comprehensive site planning and terrain modification for a high-profile estate. The client—a longtime
    collaborator across multiple projects—requested a complete property transformation to accommodate a new
    residence while integrating specific recreational and functional requirements into a challenging
    hillside site.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Design Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    The property presented significant topographic challenges: steep slopes, a mountainous backdrop, and
    limited flat terrain. The client's vision required dramatic intervention—cutting into the mountainside
    to create usable space while maintaining the site's visual relationship to the surrounding landscape.
    The program called for full-sized athletic facilities (basketball and soccer) directly accessible from
    the main residence, along with solutions for vehicle access and parking on severely sloped terrain.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Site Analysis and Survey</h2>
  <p>
    After comprehensive surveying of the entire property, I developed this master plan in close consultation
    with my father and the property owner. The planning process balanced multiple competing requirements:
    maximizing usable flat space, maintaining structural stability during and after excavation, managing
    stormwater drainage across modified terrain, and creating a sequence of outdoor spaces that felt
    intentional rather than imposed.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Design Solution</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Mountain Excavation:</strong> The most dramatic intervention involved cutting into the rear
    mountainside to create a level plateau. This required careful calculation of cut-and-fill volumes,
    ensuring that excavated material could be redistributed on-site for grading and terracing elsewhere
    on the property. The cut was designed to create stable slopes that wouldn't require excessive
    retaining structures while opening views and creating the flat area needed for athletic facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Athletic Facilities:</strong> Positioned directly off the main residence's back porch, the
    basketball and soccer field occupy the plateau created by the mountain excavation. This placement
    creates a direct visual and physical connection between the house and recreational spaces—the fields
    become an extension of the home's outdoor living areas rather than separate, distant amenities.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Access and Circulation:</strong> The steep approach to the property required careful design
    of roads, driveways, and parking areas. Rather than fighting the slope with excessive retaining walls
    or dramatic cuts, the circulation system works with the topography—using switchbacks, gentle curves,
    and strategic grading to maintain manageable grades while minimizing visual impact. Parking areas
    were carved into the hillside at appropriate points, creating level surfaces without requiring
    massive structural intervention.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Planning Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    This project represents a collaborative design process—working directly with the owner and my father
    to refine the plan through conversation and site evaluation. The drawn plan served as a communication
    tool and documentation of our collective decisions, capturing agreements about grading strategies,
    placement of major features, and circulation patterns. Unlike projects that begin with formal drawings
    and specifications, this planning effort remained flexible, allowing adjustments as we considered
    construction logistics, budget implications, and evolving client priorities.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Technical Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The plan addresses multiple technical requirements: cut-and-fill calculations to balance earthwork
    volumes, drainage patterns to manage water across modified terrain, structural considerations for
    slopes and potential retaining elements, and vehicle turning radii for driveways and parking areas.
    Each decision reflected an understanding that the built result would need to function reliably while
    appearing natural and uncontrived.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Project Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    This site plan represents the primary design documentation for the project—a comprehensive master
    plan showing topography, proposed grading, major landscape features, structures, circulation, and
    planting strategies. It captures a moment in the design process where vision, technical requirements,
    and client needs aligned into a workable proposal. The plan demonstrates how large-scale site
    transformation can create functional outdoor spaces while respecting the character of the surrounding
    landscape.
